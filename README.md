1. 

2. Had a late start due to thesis, senior project, and the Tufts 100K Venture competition. That aside, now I can focus on Assignment 3 and delve into applying what I've been learning for Node.js and Express.

3. 3 hrs (thus far--much time was placed into understand Heroku, its various apps, and what is/how to use mongodb and mongodb lab add in)
